Food away from home is an integral component of the typical American diet and food budget; it also plays a key role in the nutrition and health of Americans. Data on variation in food prices over time and across regions allow researchers to estimate how price changes affect the demand for different products\u2014such as through changes in quantities purchased or expenditures\u2014and, to examine how changes in demand, in turn, affect nutritional and health outcomes.", "title": "Quarterly Food-Away-From-Home Prices", "distribution": [{"accessURL": "https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/quarterly-food-away-from-home-prices/", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "Quarterly Food-Away-From-Home Prices"}], "license": "https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/", "bureauCode": ["005:13"], "modified": "2019-08-20", "publisher": {"@type": "org:Organization", "name": "Economic Research Service, Department of Agriculture"}, "keyword": ["agricultural economics", "away-from-home foods"]}

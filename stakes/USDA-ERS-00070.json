The aim is not to provide a single definition. Instead, it is to meet the demand for a delineation that is both geographically detailed and adjustable within reasonable ranges, in order to be usefully applied in diverse research and policy contexts. This initial set, based on urban-rural data from the 2000 decennial census, provides four separate FAR definition levels, ranging from one that is relatively inclusive (18 million FAR residents) to one that is more restrictive (4.8 million FAR residents).", "title": "Frontier and Remote Area Codes", "distribution": [{"accessURL": "https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/frontier-and-remote-area-codes/", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "State and ZIP code level tables"}], "license": "https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/", "bureauCode": ["005:13"], "modified": "2019-08-20", "publisher": {"@type": "org:Organization", "name": "Economic Research Service, Department of Agriculture"}, "describedBy": "https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/frontier-and-remote-area-codes/documentation/", "keyword": ["ZIP code", "codes", "maps", "nonmetro", "rural"], "spatial": "United States", "issued": "2019-08-20"}

Over 1 in 4 rural children are living in families that are poor, according to the official poverty measure, up from 1 in 5 in 1999, but this change was uneven across the rural landscape. Counties with high vulnerability to child poverty, those with both low young adult education levels and high proportions of children in single-parent families, were generally the most hard-hit by the recession of the past decade and experienced substantial increases in their already high child poverty rates. Along with the recession, an increase in rural children in single-parent households, continuing from the 1990s, was a major contributor to the rise in child poverty after 2000. Three factors that shape the geography of high and increasing rural child poverty are explored below: economic conditions, young adult education levels, and family structure. This collection of maps complements the July 2015 Amber Waves feature, Understanding the Geography of Growth in Rural Child Poverty.", "title": "Rural Child Poverty Chart Gallery", "distribution": [{"accessURL": "https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/rural-child-poverty-chart-gallery/", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "Rural Child Poverty Chart Gallery"}], "license": "https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/", "bureauCode": ["005:13"], "modified": "2019-03-26", "publisher": {"@type": "org:Organization", "name": "Economic Research Service, Department of Agriculture"}, "keyword": ["Agicultural economy", "child", "poverty", "rural"]}

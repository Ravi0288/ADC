The scale was constructed by combining six measures of climate, topography, and water area that reflect environmental qualities most people prefer. These measures are warm winter, winter sun, temperate summer, low summer humidity, topographic variation, and water area. The data are available for counties in the lower 48 States. The file contains the original measures and standardized scores for each county as well as the amenities scale.", "title": "Natural Amenities Scale", "distribution": [{"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "downloadURL": "https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/natural-amenities-scale.aspx", "mediaType": "application/vnd.ms-excel", "title": "Data file"}], "license": "https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/", "bureauCode": ["005:13"], "modified": "2019-08-20", "publisher": {"@type": "org:Organization", "name": "Economic Research Service, Department of Agriculture"}, "describedBy": "http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/natural-amenities-scale/documentation.aspx", "keyword": ["climate", "county", "data", "low summer humidity", "map", "natural amenities", "temperate summer", "topographic variation", "warm winter", "water area", "winter sun"], "spatial": "United States", "issued": "2019-08-20"}

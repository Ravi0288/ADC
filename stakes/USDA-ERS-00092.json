The standard Office of Management and Budget (OMB) metro and nonmetro categories have been subdivided into two metro and 10 nonmetro categories, resulting in a 12-part county classification. This scheme was originally developed in 1993. This scheme allows researchers to break county data into finer residential groups, beyond metro and nonmetro, particularly for the analysis of trends in nonmetro areas that are related to population density and metro influence. \r\n \r\nAn update of the Urban Influence Codes is planned for mid-2023.", "title": "Urban Influence Codes", "distribution": [{"accessURL": "http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/urban-influence-codes.aspx", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "description": "Excel files: 2013 Urban Influence Codes\r\n2003 and 1993 Urban influence Codes for U.S. counties\r\n2003 Urban influence Codes for Puerto Rico", "title": "Webpage with links to Excel files"}], "license": "https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/", "bureauCode": ["005:13"], "modified": "2019-10-24", "publisher": {"@type": "org:Organization", "name": "Economic Research Service, Department of Agriculture"}, "describedBy": "http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/urban-influence-codes/documentation.aspx", "keyword": ["metro", "nonmetro", "rural", "rural sociology", "urban"], "spatial": "United States", "issued": "2019-10-24"}

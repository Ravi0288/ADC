The classification contains two levels. Whole numbers (1-10) delineate metropolitan, micropolitan, small town, and rural commuting areas based on the size and direction of the primary (largest) commuting flows. These 10 codes are further subdivided to permit stricter or looser delimitation of commuting areas, based on secondary (second largest) commuting flows. The approach errs in the direction of more codes, providing flexibility in combining levels to meet varying definitional needs and preferences.\r\n \r\nThe 1990 codes are similarly defined. However, the Census Bureau's methods of defining urban cores and clusters changed between the two censuses. And, census tracts changed in number and shapes. The 2000 rural-urban commuting codes are not directly comparable with the 1990 codes because of these differences.\r\n \r\nAn update of the Rural-Urban Commuting Area Codes is planned for late 2013.", "title": "Rural-Urban Commuting Area Codes", "distribution": [{"accessURL": "http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/rural-urban-commuting-area-codes/", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "description": "2010 Rural-Urban Commuting Area Codes\r\n2000 Rural-Urban Commuting Area Codes\r\n1990 Rural-Urban Commuting Area Codes", "title": "Webpage with links to Excel files"}], "license": "https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/", "bureauCode": ["005:13"], "modified": "2019-10-24", "publisher": {"@type": "org:Organization", "name": "Economic Research Service, Department of Agriculture"}, "describedBy": "http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/rural-urban-commuting-area-codes/documentation.aspx", "keyword": ["metro", "nonmetro", "rural", "rural sociology", "urban"], "spatial": "United States", "issued": "2019-10-24"}

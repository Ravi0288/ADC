The Major Land Uses (MLU) series is the longest running, most comprehensive accounting of all major uses of public and private land in the United States. The series was started in 1945, and has since been published about every 5 years, coinciding with the Census of Agriculture. See the latest report in the series, Major Uses of Land in the United States, 2007.\r\n \r\nData from all 14 Major Land Uses reports have been combined into a set of files showing major land use estimates by region and State from 1945 to 2007. Alaska and Hawaii were added in 1959, when they achieved Statehood. Since Alaska contains such vast acreage, 50-State totals in all categories prior to 1959 may appear to change precipitously.", "title": "Major Land Uses", "distribution": [{"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "downloadURL": "https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/major-land-uses/", "mediaType": "application/vnd.ms-excel", "title": "Web page with links to Excel files"}], "bureauCode": ["005:13"], "modified": "2020-04-16", "describedBy": "http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/major-land-uses/glossary.aspx", "keyword": ["agricultural economics", "land use"], "spatial": "United States", "issued": "2020-04-16", "identifier": "USDA-ERS-00076", "accessLevel": "public", "programCode": ["005:041"], "license": "https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/", "publisher": {"@type": "org:Organization", "name": "Economic Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture"}}

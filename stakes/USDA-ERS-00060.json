Most States have production statistics available by county, field, or well, and these data were compiled at the county level to create a database of county-level production, annually for 2000 through 2011. Raw data for natural gas is for gross withdrawals, and oil data almost always include natural gas liquids. Note that State-provided natural gas withdrawals were not available for Illinois or Indiana; those estimates were produced using geocoded wells and State total production reported by the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Energy Information Agency.\r\n \r\nIn the data file, counties with increases or decreases in excess of $20 million in oil and/or natural gas production during 2000-11 are also identified.

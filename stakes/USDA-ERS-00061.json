To provide policy-relevant information about diverse county conditions to policymakers, public officials, and researchers, ERS has developed a set of county-level typology codes that captures differences in economic and social characteristics.\r\n\r\nThe 2004 County Typology codes classify all U.S. counties according to six non-overlapping categories of economic dependence and seven overlapping categories of policy-relevant themes. The economic types include farming, mining, manufacturing, services, Federal/State government, and unspecialized counties. The policy types include housing stress, low education, low employment, persistent poverty, population loss, nonmetro recreation, and retirement destination. In addition, a code identifying counties with persistent child poverty is available.\r\n\r\nAn update of the County Typology codes is planned for 2014.", "title": "County Typology Codes", "distribution": [{"accessURL": "https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/county-typology-codes/", "@type": "dcat:Distribution", "title": "Download page"}], "bureauCode": ["005:13"], "modified": "2019-10-23", "describedBy": "http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/county-typology-codes/documentation.aspx", "keyword": ["county classifications", "economics"], "spatial": "United States", "issued": "2019-10-23", "identifier": "USDA-ERS-00061", "accessLevel": "public", "programCode": ["005:041"], "license": "https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/", "publisher": {"@type": "org:Organization", "name": "Economic Research Service, Department of Agriculture"}}
